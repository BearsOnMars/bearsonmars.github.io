      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some background sound is always preferable to avoid our minds from chattering away. Well that has been my experience. I do not understand why it happens. Spiritual teachers such as the Buddha have suggested that if we are able to keep our minds from thinking about anything for even a single minute, we are already enlightened. It seems such an easy thing to say but incredibly hard to put into action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
