      <title>On Jealousy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Where does Jealousy come from? What force makes someone want to covet what&#xA;others have? One way to think about jealousy might be to associate it with a&#xA;desire of some form, coupled with perhaps a feeling of inadequacy at not&#xA;possessing that object or entity of desire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Could there be a positive angle to jealousy though? It would be easy to make an&#xA;argument that jealousy is a cancerous emotion which keeps gnawing away steadily&#xA;where it resides. It certainly is distracting by nature. Having said that, is&#xA;this emotion still desirable if it leads to some personal transformation or&#xA;evolution of some kind? I am not sure. I suppose jealousy will form a new object of&#xA;desire once it fills the gap of what it was yearning originally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some background sound is always preferable to avoid our minds from chattering away. Well that has been my experience. I do not understand why it happens. Spiritual teachers such as the Buddha have suggested that if we are able to keep our minds from thinking about anything for even a single minute, we are already enlightened. It seems such an easy thing to say but incredibly hard to put into action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
