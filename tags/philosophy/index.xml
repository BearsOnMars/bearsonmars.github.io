      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How to get the intended message across as efficiently and as unambiguously as&#xA;possible in the shortest amount of time - is a question many of us might have&#xA;asked ourself at one point. I wish I knew the right answer. But, in the spirit&#xA;of enquiry, I shall endeavour to find a half decent answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <title>On Jealousy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Where does Jealousy come from? What force makes someone want to covet what&#xA;others have? One way to think about jealousy might be to associate it with a&#xA;desire of some form, coupled with perhaps a feeling of inadequacy at not&#xA;possessing that object or entity of desire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Could there be a positive angle to jealousy though? It would be easy to make an&#xA;argument that jealousy is a cancerous emotion which keeps gnawing away steadily&#xA;where it resides. It certainly is distracting by nature. Having said that, is&#xA;this emotion still desirable if it leads to some personal transformation or&#xA;evolution of some kind? I am not sure. I suppose jealousy will form a new object of&#xA;desire once it fills the gap of what it was yearning originally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
