Now does that mean that Indus Valley was a more &ldquo;equal&rdquo; civilisation compared to let&rsquo;s say the Ancient Egyptian civilisation, with its vanity projects such as the Pyramids?

<ul>
<li>The <strong>Indus Valley civilization</strong> was among the first to adopt agriculture. It featured grid-patterned cities, standardized brick sizes, flushed toilets, toys, and the wheel.</li>
<li>It raises a question: If all buildings in the Indus Valley were of a similar size, does that necessarily mean it was a <strong>more equal society</strong>? (This contrasts with modern skyscrapers, which might be modern equivalents of Pyramids or the Acropolis).</li>
<li>The <strong>plough</strong> enabled more productive agriculture. Modern tractors and large-scale farming operate on the same fundamental idea, just with automation.</li>
<li>Societies that adopted the plough tended to become <strong>more unequal in terms of gender</strong>.</li>
<li>Early humans discovered that <strong>fermentation</strong> could keep food and drink usable for longer periods.</li>
<li>A larger <strong>agricultural base</strong> supports a larger population, which in turn fuels greater industrial might and a more formidable war machine.</li>
<li>Ancient civilizations had equivalents of <strong>central institutions</strong>, such as banks, that kept ledgers of transactions and assets.</li>
<li>Under <strong>feudalism</strong>, many people were willing to live as serfs or peasants in exchange for regular food and protection from their lords.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-core-economic-principles">2. Core Economic Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic incentives</strong> are a primary driver for innovation and the creation of labor-saving devices.</li>
<li><strong>Free markets</strong> tend to punish cronyism and nepotism.</li>
<li><strong>Command-and-control economies</strong> generally experience shortages of daily essentials, which is not a feature of free-market systems.
<ul>
<li><strong>Mao&rsquo;s &ldquo;Great Leap Forward&rdquo; (1958)</strong> is a key example. This &ldquo;madcap plan&rdquo; encouraged farmers to produce steel in backyard furnaces, melting millions of good pots and pans into scrap. A campaign to eliminate sparrows (which ate grain) led to their mass death, which in turn allowed locusts to devour the next year&rsquo;s crop. This contributed to a famine that killed tens of millions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Imperfect Competition:</strong> Economic models (like Marshall&rsquo;s) often assume &ldquo;perfect competition&rdquo; (many buyers and sellers). However, Joan Robinson&rsquo;s work (1933) argued this is a <strong>special case</strong>. The normal state of affairs includes <strong>monopolies</strong> and <strong>oligopolies</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Monopsony:</strong> Robinson also introduced this concept, which is the reverse of a monopoly. It&rsquo;s a market with only one buyer, giving that buyer pricing power over its suppliers (e.g., a &ldquo;one-company town&rdquo; paying workers less, or a massive supermarket chain squeezing farmers).</li>
<li><strong>Supply and demand</strong> (the &ldquo;Marshallian Cross&rdquo;) function like the blades of a pair of scissors. The supply curve slopes up, while the demand curve slopes down due to diminishing marginal utility. The equilibrium price is where they cross.</li>
<li>Economist Alfred Marshall distinguished between a company’s <strong>fixed costs</strong> (e.g., land, buildings) and its <strong>variable costs</strong> (e.g., labor, raw materials). In the short term, prices are most affected by variable costs.</li>
<li><strong>Economics and Math:</strong> Marshall argued that <strong>mathematics</strong> should be used as a &ldquo;shorthand language&rdquo; to illustrate real-world examples, but not become esoteric. Paul Samuelson also famously introduced more mathematics into economics, which makes sense as math is the language of the universe.</li>
<li>The <strong>&ldquo;Tragedy of the Commons&rdquo; is not inevitable</strong>. Elinor Ostrom&rsquo;s research showed that user management can succeed when locals are involved in creating and enforcing rules, with clear mechanisms for resolving disputes.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-trade-globalization--colonialism">3. Trade, Globalization &amp; Colonialism</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specialization</strong> between societies is the basis of trade.</li>
<li>Trade is most beneficial when it is based on <strong>comparative advantage</strong>, as seen with the Silk Route.</li>
<li><strong>Protectionism:</strong> If a society believes it is losing its comparative advantage, it may resort to protectionism or a trade war (e.g., the US in 2025, driven by fears of service competition from China).</li>
<li><strong>Import Substitution Industrialization:</strong> Advocated by Raúl Prebisch in Argentina, this theory suggested low-income countries should <em>not</em> specialize. Instead, they should build a diverse domestic manufacturing base and use high tariffs to discourage imports. This approach proved damaging (especially when taxing production goods like tractors) and was largely abandoned.</li>
<li><strong>Trade Barriers:</strong> Trade becomes uneconomical when the <strong>cost of transport</strong> is high relative to the value of the product being shipped.</li>
<li><strong>Forced trade:</strong> In 1853, the United States used warships to demand that Japan end its trade restrictions, helping to end the shogun era. The subsequent Meiji restoration opened Japan to the world, emphasizing education and technology adoption under the slogan ‘rich country, strong army’.</li>
<li><strong>Tariffs:</strong> Benjamin Franklin noted that &ldquo;no nation was ever ruined by trade.&rdquo; However, even as Europe and North America promoted open trade, they used tariffs. Tariffs were a major source of government revenue (funding wars like the Napoleonic and US Civil Wars) but are generally bad for the economy, like &ldquo;putting rocks in its own harbours.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The <strong>Suez Canal (1869)</strong> almost halved the sea distance from London to the Arabian Sea.</li>
<li><strong>Colonialism and inequality:</strong> Imperial powers tightly constrained colonial exports and managed trade for the benefit of the center. From 1820 to 1900, living standards in Europe more than doubled, while those in Asia and Africa did not rise at all.</li>
<li>European investment was absent in areas considered hostile or high-risk for health, such as West Africa.</li>
<li>The founders of Yale University and the Twinnings tea company both worked for the <strong>British East India Company</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Migration:</strong> In the 19th century, travel across borders was often unimpeded by passports. The 1851 gold discoveries in Australia caused the settler population to quadruple in two decades. Economists largely see migration as people relocating to be safer, happier, and more productive; migrants are a source of both supply (labor, ideas) and demand (consumption).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-labor-slavery--inequality">4. Labor, Slavery &amp; Inequality</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slavery</strong> in the ancient world reduced the incentive for people to innovate and improve labor productivity.</li>
<li>New Orleans was a major <strong>slave port</strong>. Slaves were forced onto labor-intensive industries, particularly <strong>cotton, tobacco, and sugar</strong>.</li>
<li>A question raised by the text: Why did the slave trade primarily go from <strong>east to west</strong> instead of the other way around?</li>
<li><strong>Full Employment and Racial Equality:</strong> Economist Sadie Alexander noted that some policies to help poor whites inadvertently harmed African Americans (e.g., FDR&rsquo;s National Industrial Recovery Act led to employers firing Black workers and hiring whites). She argued <strong>full employment was essential</strong> for racial equality, as Black workers were often the &ldquo;last to be hired and the first to be fired.&rdquo; Full employment also improves racial attitudes by reducing &ldquo;fears of economic rivalry,&rdquo; making political demagogues less likely to find a foothold.</li>
<li><strong>Unions:</strong> Trade unions were created to counter the massive bargaining power of corporations. They have shaped sick leave, holiday pay, weekend pay loadings, safety standards, anti-discrimination laws, and pay. Unionization is a contest between employees organizing and employers creating new workplaces, which is why rates are higher in factories and the public sector than in start-ups.</li>
<li><strong>Theories of Inequality:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Education vs. Technology:</strong> Inequality may depend on the relative growth of education and technology. If technology advances faster than education, inequality rises. If education outpaces technology, inequality falls.</li>
<li><strong>Piketty (r &gt; g):</strong> Thomas Piketty proposed that inequality rises when <strong>r &gt; g</strong> (the rate of return on capital is greater than the rate of economic growth). This is because capital assets are already skewed toward the affluent. In the post-war decades, r &lt; g, so inequality fell.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Luck and Inequality:</strong> Worldwide, most differences in income are determined by a person&rsquo;s country of birth and the social position of their parents—factors largely due to luck.</li>
<li><strong>Gains from Industrial Revolution:</strong> The gains took a surprisingly long time to flow to British workers. By the 1830s, half a century in, real wages had hardly grown.</li>
<li><strong>Australian Labor:</strong> In the 1880s, <strong>Australian wages were the highest in the world</strong> due to labor scarcity. This gave workers more power, and Australia was among the first countries to win the eight-hour workday, allow women to vote, and set a national minimum wage.</li>
<li>A question: What happens when the barriers to education are personal motivation and free time?</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-technology-innovation--the-industrial-revolution">5. Technology, Innovation &amp; The Industrial Revolution</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Industrial Revolution</strong> was a combination of multiple revolutions: Agricultural, Urban, Technological, Capital Markets, Political (Liberty), and Economic.</li>
<li><strong>Technology Lags:</strong> There was a significant gap between invention and widespread adoption. The Newcomen steam engine (1720) was refined by Watt (1760), but the first train line wasn&rsquo;t built until 1830. This lag may have been due to the slower movement of information before the <strong>electric telegraph</strong> (c. 1850s).</li>
<li>Stable economic and political environments lead to faster adoption of <strong>General Purpose Technologies (GPTs)</strong>. The benefits also lag: electric motor gains were seen post-WWI (1920s), and PC gains post-Cold War (1990s). This raises a question: Is every GPT associated with a war?</li>
<li><strong>Survivorship Bias:</strong> WWII advanced econometrics. Mathematician Abraham Wald, looking at returning bombers, recognized that the military should reinforce the spots that had <em>no damage</em>. The absence of holes in places like the nose suggested that bombers hit in those spots <em>did not return at all</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>assembly line</strong> (Ford, 1908) was inspired by Chicago slaughterhouses. The radical idea was to move the <em>product</em> (the car) toward the <em>parts</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Skyscrapers</strong> required the Bessemer process (mass-produced steel) and the passenger elevator. They first appeared in gridded US cities where zoning laws were less restrictive than in Europe.</li>
<li><strong>Mirrors</strong> were invented in 1835. Did this lead to a more self-centered society?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Future Speculation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Life expectancy doubled in 200 years. Could humans be living to 150 on average by 2200?</li>
<li>What if a government built a new city from scratch for 2.5 million families, built <em>entirely by autonomous bots</em> with no human entry until completion?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="6-institutions-policy--public-goods">6. Institutions, Policy &amp; Public Goods</h2>
<ul>
<li>Economic success requires <strong>political institutions</strong> to truly bear fruit.</li>
<li><strong>Corporations</strong>, like the Dutch and British East India Company, were vital for pooling investor risk in ventures like building railways or exploration.</li>
<li>The 1855 <strong>Limited Liability Act</strong> (UK) was key, encouraging investment by ensuring owners could not lose more than they invested.</li>
<li>During Adam Smith&rsquo;s time, there were <strong>no anti-competitive laws</strong> against companies.</li>
<li><strong>Central banks</strong> (which have existed since the 1600s) provide stability. Because commercial banks &ldquo;borrow short and lend long,&rdquo; they are vulnerable to bank runs. A central bank guarantee on deposits prevents panics, making <strong>financial stability a public good</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Privatization:</strong> This policy was likely &ldquo;overhyped.&rdquo; In many cases, <strong>natural monopolies</strong> (like railways) were sold. While this bolstered government coffers in the short term, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;crummy deal&rdquo; if it just locks in a monopoly that pushes up prices for consumers for decades. Economists are now more skeptical of privatizing monopolies.</li>
<li><strong>Michael Porter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Five Forces&rdquo;:</strong> These determine if a firm can enjoy high profits: (1) no competition, (2) barriers to entry, (3) low supplier bargaining power, (4) few customer alternatives, and (5) no substitute products. These forces are <strong>good for profits but bad for consumers</strong>. Competition policy runs in the exact opposite direction.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of Government &amp; Tax:</strong> After WWII, the government&rsquo;s role in the economy grew, along with taxation. The &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; tax system, where tax is collected at the source by the employer, was introduced. Workers are less likely to resent a tax on money they never saw in the first place.</li>
<li><strong>Progressive Taxation:</strong> In the post-war era, redistribution occurred via welfare and highly progressive income taxes, where top earners paid a much higher percentage (e.g., The Beatles&rsquo; song &ldquo;Taxman&rdquo;).</li>
<li><strong>Social Insurance:</strong> In the 1880s, German chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced reforms for health insurance, accident insurance, and old-age pensions.</li>
<li><strong>Public Health:</strong> In the 1860s, France built a massive sewerage system in Paris. Connecting homes to sewers (&ldquo;the drain gain&rdquo;) and Louis Pasteur&rsquo;s germ theory helped reduce infectious diseases and spurred urbanization by making cities safer.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="7-war-crises--economic-shocks">7. War, Crises &amp; Economic Shocks</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Black Death</strong> plague caused one-third of the European population to perish, leading to significant economic changes.</li>
<li><strong>Spain&rsquo;s economy crashed</strong> after an excess of gold and silver from the Americas flooded its shores, raising prices for domestic produce and increasing imports.</li>
<li><strong>The Great Depression (1930s):</strong>
<ul>
<li>It is called &ldquo;Great&rdquo; partly because it lasted so long. Some nations pursued <strong>austerity</strong> (cutting government budgets) instead of Keynesian stimulus.</li>
<li>It was prolonged by a <strong>&ldquo;retreat from openness.&rdquo;</strong> In the wake of WWI, tariffs went up (e.g., the 1930 US Smoot-Hawley Act on over 20,000 imports), immigration restrictions tightened (the US effectively banned all migrants from Asia), and international capital flows (investment) dried up.</li>
<li>After the 1929 crash (where the market fell 89% by 1932), the crisis spread as businesses stopped investing and people stopped spending. US unemployment peaked at 25%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>US Civil War (1861-1865):</strong>
<ul>
<li>This was an industrial-scale conflict. The North&rsquo;s economic advantages (2x population, 90% of manufacturing, 97% of firearms) ultimately determined the outcome.</li>
<li>The South financed 60% of its war costs through <strong>inflation</strong>. By the war&rsquo;s end, goods in the South cost 92 times as much.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>World War I:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The war broke the interconnected world, stopping trade and migration. The side with the larger economic base (the Allied powers) eventually won.</li>
<li>Post-war <strong>German hyperinflation</strong> was caused by the government printing money to pay the 132 billion gold mark reparations. An item costing 1 mark in 1918 cost 1 trillion marks in 1923.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>World War II:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic factors</strong> were among its causes, including Japan&rsquo;s lack of domestic energy, German resentment over hyperinflation and reparations, and Germany&rsquo;s desire to control oil reserves near the Caspian Sea.</li>
<li>The Allied powers had a decisive resource advantage (2x people, 7x territory, 40% higher income).</li>
<li>Germany&rsquo;s early victories were due to tactics (blitzkrieg), but the war was ultimately a contest of <strong>industrial production</strong>.</li>
<li>The Allies produced far more munitions (e.g., 9/10ths of all aircraft carriers) by devoting a larger <em>combined</em> share of their economies to the war effort. The Axis powers were &ldquo;literally outgunned.&rdquo;</li>
<li>WWII introduced new tech like jet fighters, cruise missiles, and atomic bombs, claiming 3x as many lives as WWI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Post-War Recovery:</strong> Through the <strong>Marshall Plan</strong>, the US provided $13 billion to Western Europe, which was about 3% of the region&rsquo;s total annual economic output (implying an output of ~$400 billion).</li>
<li><strong>Financing War (General):</strong> The British suspended the gold standard to increase their money supply and achieve their war aims against France.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="8-key-economic-thinkers--theories">8. Key Economic Thinkers &amp; Theories</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>John Maynard Keynes:</strong> Argued that the Great Depression was a problem of interconnected actions (one person&rsquo;s spending is another&rsquo;s income). His solution was for the <strong>government to spend money</strong> to restart the economy.</li>
<li><strong>Friedrich Hayek:</strong> Saw economic downturns as a <strong>necessary &ldquo;clean-out&rdquo;</strong> of bad investments from a boom. He believed government intervention would only make things worse.</li>
<li><strong>Keynes vs. Hayek:</strong> Keynes was optimistic and saw a valuable role for government. Hayek was austere and feared government eroded liberty. Keynes&rsquo;s social connections and confidence helped make his ideas more influential at the time.</li>
<li><strong>Alfred Marshall:</strong> Developed the Supply/Demand model (&ldquo;Marshallian Cross&rdquo;) and emphasized that economics must explain the real world, using math only as a tool.</li>
<li><strong>Joan Robinson:</strong> Argued that <strong>imperfect competition</strong> (monopolies) is the norm, not the exception, and introduced the concept of <strong>monopsony</strong> (a single powerful buyer).</li>
<li><strong>Sadie Alexander:</strong> Argued that <strong>full employment</strong> was the key to achieving racial equality and a stable democracy.</li>
<li><strong>Thomas Piketty:</strong> Proposed the <strong>&ldquo;r &gt; g&rdquo;</strong> formula to explain rising inequality, where the return on capital (r) outpaces economic growth (g).</li>
<li><strong>David Galenson:</strong> Identified two types of innovators: <strong>Conceptualists</strong> (early breakthrough ideas, e.g., Picasso) and <strong>Experimentalists</strong> (late-life mastery from trial and error, e.g., Cézanne).</li>
<li><strong>Elinor Ostrom:</strong> Showed that the &ldquo;Tragedy of the Commons&rdquo; can be solved by local user management.</li>
<li><strong>Abraham Wald:</strong> Identified <strong>survivorship bias</strong> during WWII, leading to the insight of reinforcing bombers where they <em>weren&rsquo;t</em> hit.</li>
<li><strong>Michael Porter:</strong> Outlined the <strong>&ldquo;five forces&rdquo;</strong> that allow a firm to secure high profits (e.g., high barriers to entry, no competition).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="9-business-society--culture">9. Business, Society &amp; Culture</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retail innovation (Harry Selfridge, 1909):</strong> Made shopping &ldquo;fun&rdquo; (Selfridges). He allowed customers to handle items, trained staff to specialize, and used the slogan &ldquo;the customer is always right.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Retail innovation (Frank Woolworth):</strong> Created &ldquo;five-and-dime stores&rdquo; based on &ldquo;pile ’em high and sell ’em cheap.&rdquo; He used his large network&rsquo;s buying power to negotiate lower prices.</li>
<li><strong>Religious competition:</strong> The text notes that the strictest doctrines, such as Mormonism and Islam, tend to have the highest birthrates.</li>
<li><strong>Adoption of ideas:</strong> The social standing and amiableness of a theory&rsquo;s proponent may dictate how much their ideas are adopted.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="10-the-role--lessons-of-economics">10. The Role &amp; Lessons of Economics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Economists only developed a deep understanding of the <strong>business cycle</strong> after the Great Depression. Early economists were too &ldquo;entranced by the efficiency of markets&rdquo; and underestimated both market failure and the potential role of government.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The core of economic thinking involves a few key concepts:
* Consider the <strong>opportunity costs</strong> (what are you giving up?).
* <strong>Think on the margin</strong> (is one more of something worth it?).
* Don&rsquo;t forget <strong>externalities</strong> (the positive and negative impacts of your decisions on other people).</p>
