I have been a financial derivatives trader, a data scientist, a chef, a spiritual guide, a painter, a writer - and I continue to be all of them. I enjoy testing the limits of what I am capable of doing professionally. There are infinite possibilities to explore.
At the core of my being is the desire to understand, manipulate, model and communicate the story behind words and numbers which govern the world and ideas around us. I am equally adept and comfortable with both of them. I am thrilled about the opportunities in this brave new AI world to usher in a preternatural era of prosperity and growth for all." />

          <p>Hello, I am called Anuj Kumar and thank you for showing an interest in learning about me.</p>
<p>I have been a financial derivatives trader, a data scientist, a chef, a spiritual guide, a painter, a writer - and I continue to be all of them. I enjoy testing the limits of what I am capable of doing professionally. There are infinite possibilities to explore.</p>
<p>At the core of my being is the desire to understand, manipulate, model and communicate the story behind words and numbers which govern the world and ideas around us. I am equally adept and comfortable with both of them. I am thrilled about the opportunities in this brave new AI world to usher in a preternatural era of prosperity and growth for all.</p>
<p>My preferable method of consuming information is in textual, written format because I believe reading is way faster than watching or listening. I enjoy reading non-fiction books on economics, business, history, philosophy, politics and geography - to improve my understanding of where humans have been and where we are headed.</p>
<p>I am a quietly optimistic person, driven by the desire to understand myself and the world around me. I would like to use these pages as an outlet to share my lived experience and make an infinitesimal contribution to the shared human knowledge.</p>
<p>Please feel free to get in touch if you have any suggestions or if you just want a quick chat.</p>
