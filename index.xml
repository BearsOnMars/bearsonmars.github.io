      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;graphs-and-network-modeling&#34;&gt;Graphs and Network Modeling&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the graph approach to analysis, you consider that the world is&#xA;connected and, therefore, the entities are often not independent.&#xA;Information about network leaders - or key nodes - can help find the most efficient way to spread information.&#xA;Finding the most critical nodes can help disrupt or upgrade the resilience of  the network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a graph?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;used more in mathematical terminology and refers to a general language for describing and analysing entities and their relations or interactions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a network?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a real-world dataset containing entities and their relationships, such as a social network, a communication network, or a road network.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;problems-suitable-for-network-analysis&#34;&gt;Problems suitable for Network Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below are the scenarios uniquely suitable for graph-based analysis:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How to get the intended message across as efficiently and as unambiguously as&#xA;possible in the shortest amount of time - is a question many of us might have&#xA;asked ourself at one point. I wish I knew the right answer. But, in the spirit&#xA;of enquiry, I shall endeavour to find a half decent answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <title>How Economics Explains the World - by Andrew Leigh</title>
      <link>https://bearsonmars.github.io/bookshelf/economics_leigh/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;thoughts-on-agriculture-and-building-heights&#34;&gt;Thoughts on Agriculture and Building heights&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Leigh says that Indus valley civilisation was among the firsts to adopt agriculture, grid patterned cities, ideal brick sizes, flushed toilets, toys, wheel etc. And the buildings were mostly of equal sizes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now does that mean that Indus Valley was a more &amp;ldquo;equal&amp;rdquo; civilisation compared to let&amp;rsquo;s say the Ancient Egyptian civilisation, with its vanity projects such as the Pyramids? Could the argument be further stretched to include our contemporary societies with a limited number of skyscrapers concentrated in downtown of a particular city? Is there any city on this planet in 21st century with similar sized buildings all over? Singapore, perhaps? Not sure, really. If there is, it probably is more equal. Why would residents accept public funds to be spent on some structure which most of them would not see the insides of in their lifetimes?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Jealousy</title>
      <link>https://bearsonmars.github.io/posts/jealousy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Where does Jealousy come from? What force makes someone want to covet what&#xA;others have? One way to think about jealousy might be to associate it with a&#xA;desire of some form, coupled with perhaps a feeling of inadequacy at not&#xA;possessing that object or entity of desire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Could there be a positive angle to jealousy though? It would be easy to make an&#xA;argument that jealousy is a cancerous emotion which keeps gnawing away steadily&#xA;where it resides. It certainly is distracting by nature. Having said that, is&#xA;this emotion still desirable if it leads to some personal transformation or&#xA;evolution of some kind? I am not sure. I suppose jealousy will form a new object of&#xA;desire once it fills the gap of what it was yearning originally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Streamlit webapp for browsing Kindle highlights</title>
      <link>https://bearsonmars.github.io/posts/kindle_highlights/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to view the highlights and notes from the books I have read on my&#xA;Kindle to be able to make some posts for this blog, but Amazon does not make it&#xA;easy for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;My Clippings.txt&lt;/strong&gt; file, where a reader&amp;rsquo;s notes, highlights and bookmarks&#xA;are stored, is hard to read and annoying. Apparently an&#xA;industry has sprung up to help Kindle users make sense of their own notes and&#xA;clippings-for a fee ofcourse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the notes I made while reading this fascinating book. Absolutely recommed it to someone who wishes to understand how golden ages begin, and how they end - and they all DO end eventually!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dutch-republic&#34;&gt;The Dutch Republic&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The discovery of new continents and sea routes shook European consciousness and sparked a new wave of curiosity and knowledge building&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;renaissance-italy&#34;&gt;Renaissance Italy&lt;/h2&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, I am called Anuj Kumar and thank you for showing an interest in learning about me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been a financial derivatives trader, a data scientist, a chef, a spiritual guide, a painter, a writer - and I continue to be all of them. I enjoy testing the limits of what I am capable of doing professionally. There are infinite possibilities to explore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the core of my being is the desire to understand, manipulate, model and communicate the story behind words and numbers which govern the world and ideas around us. I am equally adept and comfortable with both of them. I am thrilled about the opportunities in this brave new AI world to usher in a preternatural era of prosperity and growth for all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Music which does not distract</title>
      <link>https://bearsonmars.github.io/posts/non_distracting_music/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some background sound is always preferable to avoid our minds from chattering away. Well that has been my experience. I do not understand why it happens. Spiritual teachers such as the Buddha have suggested that if we are able to keep our minds from thinking about anything for even a single minute, we are already enlightened. It seems such an easy thing to say but incredibly hard to put into action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tron:Ares review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This movie is a feast for the senses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The red color is star of the show, which is to be expected from the title&amp;rsquo;s allusion to the Greek god of warfare and bloodshed. The cinematography is brilliant; CGI hits the sweet spot and my god the soundtrack by Nine Inch Nails! Some have even gone as far as to suggest that the movie is essentially a video companion to their music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
