      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to view the highlights and notes from the books I have read on my&#xA;Kindle to be able to make some posts for this blog, but Amazon don&amp;rsquo;t make it&#xA;easy for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;My Clippings.txt&lt;/strong&gt; file, where a reader&amp;rsquo;s notes, highlights and bookmarks&#xA;are stored, is hard to read and annoying. Apparently an&#xA;industry has come up to help users make sense of their own notes and&#xA;clippings-for a fee ofcourse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the notes I made while reading this fascinating book. Absolutely recommed it to someone who wishes to understand how golden ages begin, and how they end - and they all DO end eventually!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dutch-republic&#34;&gt;The Dutch Republic&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The discovery of new continents and sea routes shook European consciousness and sparked a new wave of curiosity and knowledge building&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;renaissance-italy&#34;&gt;Renaissance Italy&lt;/h2&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, I am called Anuj Kumar and thank you for showing an interest in learning about me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been a financial derivatives trader, a data scientist, a chef, a spiritual guide, a painter, a writer - and I continue to be all of them. I enjoy testing the limits of what I am capable of doing professionally. There are infinite possibilities to explore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the core of my being is the desire to understand, manipulate, model and communicate the story behind words and numbers which govern the world and ideas around us. I am equally adept and comfortable with both of them. I am thrilled about the opportunities in this brave new AI world to usher in a preternatural era of prosperity and growth for all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Music which does not distract</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some background sound is always preferable to avoid our minds from chattering away. Well that has been my experience. I do not understand why it happens. Spiritual teachers such as the Buddha have suggested that if we are able to keep our minds from thinking about anything for even a single minute, we are already enlightened. It seems such an easy thing to say but incredibly hard to put into action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tron:Ares review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This movie is a feast for the senses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The red color is star of the show, which is to be expected from the title&amp;rsquo;s allusion to the Greek god of warfare and bloodshed. The cinematography is brilliant; CGI hits the sweet spot and my god the soundtrack by Nine Inch Nails! Some have even gone as far as to suggest that the movie is essentially a video companion to their music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
