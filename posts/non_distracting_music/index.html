          <p>Some background sound is always preferable to avoid our minds from chattering away. Well that has been my experience. I do not understand why it happens. Spiritual teachers such as the Buddha have suggested that if we are able to keep our minds from thinking about anything for even a single minute, we are already enlightened. It seems such an easy thing to say but incredibly hard to put into action.</p>
<p>I used to enjoy listening to rock music and reading between the lines of the songs which I love. I am perhaps someone who gets affected more than usual by what others are saying. I did not wish to be dragged in someone else&rsquo;s trip anymore. What do I care about what the songwriter feels and did. I realised that I was just interested in the beats and the music itself.</p>
<p>Music does not need the crutch of words for it to make any sense. It is complete in itself. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/ev8qw6uwl3kzp08gfx7djqwqy?si=2733a8037aa944de">Here</a> is a link to my Spotify profile with my playlists I have built over the years. So to avoid being sucked into other people&rsquo;s thoughts I began to listen to pure soundtracks, classical music, jazz (a personal favorite), classical strings, hindustani classical.. and so on.</p>
<p>These days I just listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX3JNwc30ddaO?si=G6T_R2SHT0u2d0E6iJC3TA">Tibetan Bowl sounds</a>. It brings me peace and actually helps me focus on the task at hand by adding a protective sound cover between myself and my undesirable thoughts.</p>
<p>More on spirituality and Buddha later.</p>
