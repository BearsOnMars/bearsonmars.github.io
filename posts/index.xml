      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some background sound is always preferable to avoid our minds from chattering away. Well that has been my experience. I do not understand why it happens. Spiritual teachers such as the Buddha have suggested that if we are able to keep our minds from thinking about anything for even a single minute, we are already enlightened. It seems such an easy thing to say but incredibly hard to put into action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This movie is a feast for the senses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The red color is star of the show, which is to be expected from the title&amp;rsquo;s allusion to the Greek god of warfare and bloodshed. The cinematography is brilliant; CGI hits the sweet spot and my god the soundtrack by Nine Inch Nails! Some have even gone as far as to suggest that the movie is essentially a video companion to their music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
