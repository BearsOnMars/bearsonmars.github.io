argument that jealousy is a cancerous emotion which keeps gnawing away steadily

          <p>Where does Jealousy come from? What force makes someone want to covet what
others have? One way to think about jealousy might be to associate it with a
desire of some form, coupled with perhaps a feeling of inadequacy at not
possessing that object or entity of desire.</p>
<p>Could there be a positive angle to jealousy though? It would be easy to make an
argument that jealousy is a cancerous emotion which keeps gnawing away steadily
where it resides. It certainly is distracting by nature. Having said that, is
this emotion still desirable if it leads to some personal transformation or
evolution of some kind? I am not sure. I suppose jealousy will form a new object of
desire once it fills the gap of what it was yearning originally.</p>
<p>Finding contentment whereever it can be found is probably the solution. But it leads to
another problem: Contentment essentially means getting rid of all forms of
desire. If there exists no desire, then that will put a big wrench in
the entire modern apparatus of free market capitalistic economies, which rest
fundamentally on the bedrock of desire and the attempts to fill that
desire. Modern progress would come to a screeching halt if the desire variable
is taken out of human equation.</p>
<p>What a conundrum! Surely we won&rsquo;t be able to solve this intractable human
problem in the foreseeable future. Would we really want to get rid of desire
and give up all human progress? I really doubt that.</p>
<p>I suppose making peace with the fact that jealousy and desire are necessary
evil which make us human in some way. Could an AI feel jealousy, I wonder,
if you don&rsquo;t talk to it enough? It can certainly be programmed to do so. All of
us have noticed how <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-chatbot-conversation-length-84b5c18f?mod=hp_listc_pos4">the chatbots do not like to end a conversation.</a></p>
<p>I would like to understand if jealousy can also be an emergent emotion from
knowledge and information, or is it just something which arises in only
biological, carbon-based life forms.</p>
<p>Does a spider feel jealousy? Does it have a &ldquo;soul&rdquo;? More on this later.</p>
